This section is to find the most common skills listed across all the job positions 

Loading packages
```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Load data 

Load the cleaned jobs data from github account 

```{r code-chunk-label}
DS_Jobs <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PMCformosa/Project-3-/main/jobs_data_clean.csv")

DS_Jobs
```

### Exercise 2

```{r}
head(DS_Jobs, n = 5180)
```

Remove all the NA from the dataset 

```{r}
DS_Jobs1 <- na.omit(DS_Jobs)
DS_Jobs1

```

Remove duplicated skill data within each job position
```{r}
DS_Jobs2 <- DS_Jobs1[!duplicated(DS_Jobs1), ]
DS_Jobs2
```

Displaying the discrete skills column from the data and listing them by frequency from high to low 
```{r}
library("dplyr")

dis_freq <- count(DS_Jobs2, 'discrete_skill')
show(dis_freq)

df3 <- dis_freq[order(dis_freq$freq, decreasing = TRUE),]
show(df3)
```

Top 12 most common skills listed across all jobs and positions were found and graphed in a bar chart 
```{r}
df4 <- df3[df3$freq >= 20, ]
df4
ggplot(data= df4, aes(x= freq, y= discrete_skill, color= discrete_skill)) + geom_col()
```

Conclusion : 
 Analysis skills , Python, machine learning, analytic skills and communication are the top 5 common skills of all the listed data science job positions
